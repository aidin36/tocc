Tocc Users Manual
=================

Tocc comes with two official UIs: A Command Line Interface (CLI),
and a read-only File System (toccfs).

In order to learn how to work with Tocc, read
`Official Tocc CLI Documentation <../cli/index.html>`_.
After that, take a look at
`Tocc File System Documentation <../toccfs/index.html>`_
to learn how you can integrate Tocc with other applications.

Note that these are the Official UIs. There maybe some other UIs
developed for Tocc, with different features.
