Contribution
============

Tocc is a big project. Without the help of the community, it won't last long.

Not just Tocc benefits from contribution, but the contributor itself also
gain more experience.

You don't have to be a developer. There are other tasks that should be handled.
This page lists things you can help with.

If you decided to contribute, contact Aidin at *aidin (AT) t-o-c-c.com*

Development
-----------

There are various parts of the project that you can help at as a developer.
You don't have to be a professional. Any contribution is valuable.

 * **Tocc itself**: If you're a C++ developer, you can help with the Tocc project
   itself. Tocc project have three parts: main library (libtocc), official
   command line interface, and a file system (toccfs). Take a look at
   `issues <https://www.github.com/aidin36/tocc/issues/>`_ to find out what
   tasks are waiting to be done. Tasks that labeled *easy* are good points
   to start.

 * **UIs**: There can be different UIs for Tocc. CLIs, GUIs, plugins for different
   applications (i.e. file browsers like Nautilus of Dolphin).
   Each have their own features and usage.
   You can start developing a new UI for Tocc, as a separate project.

 * **libtocc wrappers**: *libtocc* is the main component of the Tocc. Its the
   engine of Tocc, and other components are just UIs for it.
   It written in C++. You can write wrappers for other languages.
   Doing that, you will learn more about underlying layers of the language your
   working with, in a fun way.

Documentation and Website
-------------------------

Documents are very important, both for the end users, and new developers that
join the project. But they aren't as fun as playing with code. That's why
developers don't write documents. And that's why documenters worth their weight
in gold.

Documents of Tocc are written using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`_.
The website is also some html files generated using Sphinx.

Translation
^^^^^^^^^^^

It will help end users a lot if they have user manuals in their own native
language. You can help the project by translating documentation to your
language.

Release Technician
------------------

In order to make it easy for users to install Tocc, we need to distribute
packages for different OSes and Distros. Since there's many of them, we need
people to handle the job.

It won't take too much time, because it should be done just when Tocc releases
a new version.

If you have some free time every three or four months, you can be the Release
Technician of you favorite OS.
